---------------------
Encrypted Password
--------------------
When a new user is created or logs in, the password is converted to an MD5 hash. This will ensure the password is not stored
in plain text in the database. When a user logs in, the password is encrypted then compared to the persisted value in the database.

---------------------
Seeding an Admin User
---------------------
The DB seed task has the ability to add an admin user with a password specified by the user. The command is as follows:

rake db:seed password=[password]

----------------------------
Compatible Image Generation
----------------------------

Image generation has been changed to the IMGKit gem backed by wkhtmltoimage. The executable is stored in the bin folder of the
application so local installation is not necessary (NOTE: not compatible with an AMD 64 system, the execuatable must be updated
for this case).

--------------------------
Background Job Processing
--------------------------

Image creation within the request is very slow, so Delayed Job has been added to enqueue the job once a new site is created.
In combination with the existing state machine, a user has monitor the current status of the job on page reload.
